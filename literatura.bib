The development of new technologies in both DNA synthesis and sequencing make DNA an increasingly feasible digital storage medium. We developed a strategy to encode arbitrary digital information in DNA, wrote a 5.27-megabit book using DNA microchips, and read the book by using next-generation DNA sequencing.}},

		 first approach relies on applying {PCR} at various
		 stages of the computation. We analyze its performance
		 and show that it increases the survival-probability of
		 various strands to acceptable proportions. Our second
		 approach relies on changing the method by which
		 information is encoded on {DNA} strands. This encoding
		 is likely to reduce false negative errors during the
		 bead separation procedure. }",
